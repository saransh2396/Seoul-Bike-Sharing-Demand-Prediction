# Seoul-Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction

Prediction was using Datafile name SoeulBikeSharing.CSV file of 600KB file consists of 14columns and 8670rows.

Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of renting bike on the hourly basis is given in this dataset. 
Certain features will play a major role on Bike Count so by taking care of that we have to make a model that can predict Rental Bike Count by using the independent features present in the dataset.
